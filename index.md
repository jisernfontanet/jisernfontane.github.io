Jordi Isern Fontanet (Banyoles 1975, Catalonia) graduated in Physics at Universitat de Barcelona. He developed his PhD at the Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC) and get his PhD in Applied Physics from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in 2003. JIF was enroled as a postdoctoral scientist in the Laboratoire de Physique des Océans (Ifremer, 2005-2006) funded by a Spanish grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science and in the Laboratoire d'Océanographie Spatiale (Ifremer, 2006-2008) funded by a Marie Curie Grant (EIF, FP6). In 2008 he got a Ramón y Cajal contract from the Spanish Ministry of Science and joined the Institut Català de Ciències del Clima in Barcelona, where he led the Ocean Dynamics and Climate group. In October 2014 he joined the Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC), with a permanent position since 2018. He is currently professor at the Remote Sensing and SIG master by the CREAF and Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. His current research is focused on upper ocean dynamics and geophysical turbulence.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- The multifractal theory of turbulence (DEMON project)
- Energy dissipation in ocean models (DEMON project)
- Connectivity of fish larvae (DEMON project)
