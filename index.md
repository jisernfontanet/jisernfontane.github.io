My main interests are the understanding of ocean turbulence and its role in Earthâ€™s climate, with particular attention to the upper layers of the ocean between sub-mesoscales and mesoscales. My research combines theoretical developments with the analysis of ocean numerical models and ocean observations, such satellite data.
